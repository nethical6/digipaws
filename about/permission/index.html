<h2>1. Accessibility Permission</h2>
    <p>The accessibility permission is crucial for Digipaws to function effectively. This permission allows the app to interact with and monitor the content on your device. Below are the specific features enabled by this permission:</p>

    <h2>2. Monitoring and Blocking Explicit Content</h2>
    <p>If you enable the explicit content blocker, Digipaws can monitor what you type on your device. This includes capturing text input in various apps to identify and block explicit content. The app does this by analyzing the text for keywords or patterns that match a predefined list of explicit content.</p>
    <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> This feature works entirely on your device. No text data is transmitted or stored on any servers, ensuring your privacy and data security.</p>

    <h2>3. Monitoring App Usage</h2>
    <p>When you activate the app blocker or anti-uninstall feature, Digipaws can monitor which apps are being opened on your device. This allows the app to block access to certain apps that you have deemed distracting or addictive.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>App Blocker:</strong> Prevents specified apps from being opened, helping you reduce time spent on these apps.</li>
        <li><strong>Anti-Uninstall:</strong> Monitors attempts to uninstall Digipaws and can block such actions to ensure the app remains active on your device.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Again, all monitoring occurs locally on your device, and no app usage data is sent to any external servers.</p>

    <h2>4. Monitoring Window Content</h2>
    <p>Digipaws also monitors the content of active windows on your device. This allows the app to detect and block specific types of content across different apps and screens. For example, the app can prevent the display of specific elements like short videos or block certain types of notifications that may contain addictive or distracting content.</p>
    <p>This feature helps provide a comprehensive content filtering system that works across various apps and screens, ensuring a consistent blocking experience.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Privacy and Security</h2>
    <p>We prioritize your privacy and data security. Digipaws operates entirely on your device, and no personal data is transmitted or stored on external servers. This ensures that all monitoring and blocking activities are kept private and secure.</p>
    <p>Additionally, Digipaws is an open-source application. The source code is available for review, allowing anyone to verify how the app functions and ensures transparency in its operations. The app is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3), promoting open and collaborative development.</p>

    <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>By utilizing Android accessibility permissions, Digipaws provides a powerful tool for managing screen time and blocking addictive content on your device. The app's local processing ensures your privacy, and its open-source nature guarantees transparency and trustworthiness.</p>
